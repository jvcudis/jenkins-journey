# About

Welcome to my Jenkins Journey!

Hi, I'm Ann. I'm a Fullstack Developer turned Devops Engineer. This space is where I record all the things I've learned about writing a Jenkinsfile using the declarative pipeline syntax.

This is also where I share about creating custom shared library methods â€” from implementation, testing and using them for your Jenkins pipeline.

For questions, please email me at jvcudis@gmail.com.
